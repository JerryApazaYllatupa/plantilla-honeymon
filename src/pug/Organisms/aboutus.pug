    +cardabout('Marco Antonio Condori - Founder ',
    "I born and raised in Cusco-Peru, I founded View Peru in 2012 with the idea to provide the best service possible for those clients who couldn't find a company to satisfy all their travel necessities,  I started working in the travel industry from my 18 years old, Nowadays I consider myself as a specialist, designing and operating the best itineraries in Peru and Bolivia. 2016 means a lot for me because View Peru has grown unpredictably, becoming the Top Luxury Trek operator in the Inca Trail Industry. I am behind every detail of my client's trip, I enjoy every day teaching to my team the philosophy of View Peru, which is: The Client is first.",
